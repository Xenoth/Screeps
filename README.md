# Screeps
## Description
Scripts of Xenoth's Screep colony.
### What works 
 * The colony needs a spawn structure named "Spawn1";
 * Can focus on BUILDING, HARVESTING, DEFENSE or UPGRADING modes to regulate the creep's population;
 * Spawn 4 types of creeps, Builders, Harvesters, Defenders and Upgraders;
 * Creates heavier creeps if 5 extensions are built;
 * Kinda prioritize the spawns in few cases;
 * Build roads between spawn and sources, as well as controller and sources.
 ## TODO
 * Build structures near POI (Containers and Resources);
 * Define the automaton depending on the Controller level;
 * More creeps roles;
 * Refactorings;
 * A lot of stuff.
